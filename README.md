# Understanding Application Persistence on New or Reset Devices

## Overview

When you get a brand new system or reset your current device, understanding what happens to your applications and tools is crucial for maintaining productivity and ensuring data continuity.

## What Happens During Device Reset or New Setup?

### Short Answer
**Yes, most applications and tools will be gone** when you:
- Set up a brand new device
- Perform a factory reset on your current device
- Reinstall your operating system

### Detailed Explanation

#### Applications That Are Lost
- **Installed Software**: All third-party applications, tools, and programs you've installed
- **Custom Configurations**: Settings, preferences, and customizations you've made
- **Local Data**: Files, documents, and data stored locally on the device
- **Browser Data**: Bookmarks, saved passwords, and browsing history (unless synced)
- **Development Tools**: IDEs, compilers, frameworks, and development environments

#### What Remains
- **Operating System**: The basic OS and its built-in applications
- **Cloud-Synced Data**: Data stored in cloud services (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)
- **Account-Based Services**: Applications that store data on their servers (if you remember login credentials)

## Types of Application Storage

### 1. Local Installation
- **Behavior**: Completely removed during reset
- **Examples**: Desktop software, games, productivity tools
- **Recovery**: Requires fresh installation

### 2. Cloud-Based Applications
- **Behavior**: Access restored after logging back in
- **Examples**: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, web applications
- **Recovery**: Automatic once you sign in

### 3. Portable Applications
- **Behavior**: Lost if stored locally, preserved if on external storage
- **Examples**: Portable versions of software on USB drives
- **Recovery**: Available if stored externally

## Solutions and Best Practices

### Before Reset/New Device

#### 1. Create Application Inventory
```
- List all installed applications
- Note version numbers and license keys
- Document custom configurations
- Identify critical tools and their sources
```

#### 2. Backup Strategies
- **Cloud Storage**: Sync important files to cloud services
- **External Backup**: Use external drives for large files and applications
- **Configuration Export**: Export settings from applications that support it
- **License Management**: Document software licenses and activation keys

#### 3. Use Package Managers (for developers)
- **Windows**: Chocolatey, Winget
- **macOS**: Homebrew
- **Linux**: Native package managers (apt, yum, etc.)

These allow you to reinstall applications quickly with scripts.

### After Reset/New Device Setup

#### 1. Essential Applications First
- Install critical productivity tools
- Set up development environments
- Configure security software

#### 2. Gradual Restoration
- Restore applications based on priority
- Import backed-up configurations
- Sync cloud accounts and services

#### 3. Automation Tools
- Use installation scripts
- Leverage package managers
- Employ configuration management tools

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows
- **Built-in Backup**: Windows Backup and Restore
- **Microsoft Account**: Syncs some settings across devices
- **Package Managers**: Winget, Chocolatey for easy reinstallation

### macOS
- **Time Machine**: Complete system backup solution
- **iCloud**: Syncs apps and data across Apple devices
- **Homebrew**: Package manager for development tools

### Linux
- **Package Managers**: Native tools for easy software management
- **Dotfiles**: Configuration files can be version controlled
- **Containers**: Docker for consistent development environments

### Mobile Devices
- **App Stores**: Automatic reinstallation of purchased apps
- **Cloud Backup**: iOS/Android backup services
- **Account Sync**: Most app data restored through account login

## Proactive Measures

### 1. Documentation
- Maintain a list of essential applications
- Document installation procedures
- Keep license information secure

### 2. Cloud-First Approach
- Use cloud-based alternatives when possible
- Sync settings and configurations to cloud services
- Store important files in cloud storage

### 3. Regular Backups
- Schedule automatic backups
- Test restoration procedures
- Update backup strategies regularly

### 4. Containerization (for developers)
- Use Docker for development environments
- Employ virtual machines for isolated setups
- Utilize infrastructure as code

## Recovery Checklist

After a reset or on a new device:

- [ ] Install operating system updates
- [ ] Set up cloud accounts and sync services
- [ ] Install essential applications from your inventory
- [ ] Restore backed-up files and configurations
- [ ] Reconfigure custom settings and preferences
- [ ] Test all critical applications and tools
- [ ] Update security software and run scans
- [ ] Set up new backup routines

## Conclusion

While applications and tools are indeed lost during device resets or new setups, proper planning and backup strategies can minimize disruption. The key is preparation: maintaining inventories, using cloud services, implementing backup routines, and leveraging automation tools for quick restoration.

By following these practices, you can ensure that setting up a new device or recovering from a reset becomes a manageable process rather than a catastrophic loss of productivity.
